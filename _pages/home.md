## Computational Statistics and Data Analytics Lab 

**CSDA** (Computational Statistics and Data Analytics) is a **multidisciplinary student-centered research group**, working on research projects in applied statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and AI. The following are the main areas of research (but not limited to):

- **Statistical monitoring**: Statistical methods for system monitoring purposes, including control charts, health monitoring, profile monitoring, IoT monitoring, image monitoring, etc.
- **Statistics & AI**: AI model compression techniques and optimization: fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, pruning, quantization. Multidisciplinary problems in Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Education, Sports, and Health.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: conformal predictors and robust statistics
- **Health Analytics**: sports medicine/orthopedics, cancer flow cytometry, cancer with metabolic syndromes, predictive modeling
- **Education Analytics**: AI advising chatbot, RAG systems, and predictive modeling.
- **Mathematical Statistics**: New probability distributions for various applications.
- **Tools**: Developing R packages and Shiny apps.

## Methods and Technologies

The CSDA Lab is primarily a data analytics group that uses a wide range of statistical and mathematical methods, including:
- Exploratory Statistical Analysis: Principal component analysis (PCA), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and more.
- Statistical Modeling: Poisson regression, Negative Binomial regression, Zero-Inflated models, Gamma regression, Mixed models, Time Series, hypothesis testing, Cox models, and more.
- Clustering techniques: k-means, latent class analysis (LCA), and more.
- Classification: SVM, regressions, Random forest, and more.
- Predictive models: RNN, CNN, regression, LSTM, and more.
- Imputation methods: MICE, EM, and more.
- Signal processing: Wavelet analysis, Fourier transforms, multiscale analysis, and more. 
- Tools: R, Quarto, Python, SAS, and MATLAB.
